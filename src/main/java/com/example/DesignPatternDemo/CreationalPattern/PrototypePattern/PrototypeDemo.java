        // Prototype pattern lets you copy existing objects without making
        // your code dependent on their classes.
        // An object that supports cloning is called a prototype.

        // The Java.lang.Cloneable interface is a marker interface.
        // There is a method clone() in the Object class. Cloneable interface is implemented by a class to make Object.clone() method valid thereby making field-for-field copy.
        User u2 = u1.clone();
        System.out.println("user 1: " + u2.toString());

        // Usage:
        //  1. Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.
        //  2.
